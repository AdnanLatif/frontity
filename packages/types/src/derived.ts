/**
 * Derived state is state that is calculated based on other piece of state in
 * your application.
 *
 * Derived state can have one of three types:
 * 1. JS serializable value (number, string, etc). In this case, there is no
 *   "derivation" happening.
 * 2. Function which takes the application state, actions and libraries as
 *   arguments. The final state is calculated by invoking that function.
 * 3. A curried function, which takes takes the application state, actions and libraries as
 *   arguments and returns a function that takes any number of parameters. That
 *   function works like a "getter" for a piece of state.
