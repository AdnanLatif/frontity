Comments package that adds integration for WordPress native comments.

> ## Beta version
>
> Please, bear in mind that this package is currently in beta version. It is not fully documented yet and its implementation may change with the final release.

## Install

```sh
npm i @frontity/wp-comments
```

## Usage

> In order to use this package, you will need to add a single line of configuration to your Wordpress installation:

```php
add_filter( 'rest_allow_anonymous_comments', '__return_true' );
```

You can add that directly in your `theme.php` file or use a [Code Snippets](https://wordpress.org/plugins/code-snippets/) plugin.

This package doesn't have any configuration, it should just be added in the `frontity.settings.js` to the `packages` array.

**`frontity.settings.js`**

```js
export default {
  packages: ["@frontity/wp-comments"],
};
```
