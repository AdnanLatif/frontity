Analytics package to use [Google Tag Manager](https://tagmanager.google.com/) with Frontity

## Install

```sh
npm i @frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics
```

## Settings

The [namespace](https://docs.frontity.org/learning-frontity/namespaces) for this package is **`googleTagManagerAnalytics`**

Every Google Tag Manager account has a [Container ID](https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en).  
To connect the package with a specific account (or accounts) we can set the following properties in the `frontity.settings.js`:

- `state.googleTagManagerAnalytics.containerId`: to specify just one _container ID_
- `state.googleTagManagerAnalytics.containerIds`: to specify a list of _container ID's_

```js
export default {
  packages: [
    {
      name: "@frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics",
      state: {
        googleTagManagerAnalytics: {
          containerId: "GTM-BCDFGHJ",
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

```js
export default {
  packages: [
    {
      name: "@frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics",
      state: {
        googleTagManagerAnalytics: {
          containerIds: ["GTM-BCDFGHJ", "GTM-HJSFDUF"],
        },
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Usage

This `@frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics` package can co-exist with some other `analytics` packages. Once we have properly installed and configured these `analytics` packages, their actions will be centralized by the `analytics` namespace

- `actions.analytics.pageview()` will take into account settings in `state.analytics.pageviews`
- `actions.analytics.event()` will take into account settings in `state.analytics.events`

> Read More info about how to use Analytic packages in the [docs](https://docs.frontity.org/api-reference-1/frontity-analytics)

#### `actions.analytics.pageview`

If `@frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics` is configured configured and enabled for _pageviews_ in `state.analytics.pageviews`, every time a link changes (or every time `action.router.set(link)` is launched) a tracking for that page will be sent to Google Tag Manager.

#### `actions.analytics.event`

If `@frontity/google-tag-manager-analytics` is configured and enabled for _events_ in `state.analytics.events`, every time you call the method `actions.analytics.event()` from any of your React components, the proper tracking info will be sent to Google Tag Manager.

The `actions.analytics.event()` must receive an event object with the following properties.

| Name          | Type   | Default | Required | Description                                                                                        |
| :------------ | :----- | :-----: | :------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`name`**    | string |    -    | true     | The value of this property is mapped to the `event` field of the object sent to GTM |
| **`payload`** | Object |    -    | true     | Event payload.                                                                                     |

You can add any info you want in the `payload` object.

These values will be transfomed (by this package) into the proper format before sending the data to Google Tag Manager
